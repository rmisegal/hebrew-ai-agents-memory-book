# Project Requirements Document (PRD)
## Book Reorganization and Quality Assurance Project

**Project Name:** Hebrew AI Agents Book - Complete Reorganization and Quality Enhancement
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Project Owner:** Book Author
**Technical Lead:** AI Assistant
**Document Status:** Draft for Approval

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Project Overview
This project aims to completely reorganize and enhance the Hebrew-language book "בינה מבוזרת: סוכנים אוטונומיים בעידן הבינה המלאכותית" (Distributed Intelligence: Autonomous Agents in the Age of AI). The book currently exists in a draft state with structural inconsistencies, repetitive content, and suboptimal chapter ordering. This project will transform it into a coherent, professionally structured publication that seamlessly integrates theoretical foundations with practical implementation.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
**Current Issues:**
- Chapters 1-2 are too brief (8 and 10 lines respectively)
- Ethics chapter (Ch6) appears after all technical content, making it feel like an afterthought
- Repetitive MCP protocol introductions across chapters
- Mathematical chapter (Ch7) lacks connection to practical examples
- Incomplete code in Appendix A
- Abstract doesn't mention the unique dual-implementation approach
- Inconsistent Hebrew-English language mixing
- No clear book structure overview for readers
- Abrupt transitions between theoretical and practical content

### 1.3 Vision Statement
Create a publication-ready book that:
- Reads like an original, first-edition masterpiece (not a revised version)
- Flows naturally from philosophical foundations → ethical principles → practical implementation → mathematical formalism
- Contains zero repetition while building knowledge progressively
- Uses only standardized CLS functions for Hebrew-English mixing
- Demonstrates state-of-the-art organization worthy of academic review
- Would pass scrutiny from a reader like Professor Yuval Noah Harari

## 2. Goals and Objectives

### 2.1 Primary Goals
1. **Structural Coherence**: Reorganize 7 chapters into 6 logically flowing chapters
2. **Content Quality**: Eliminate all repetitions and contradictions
3. **Progressive Learning**: Ensure each chapter builds on previous knowledge
4. **Dual-Path Clarity**: Clearly present both manual and SDK implementation approaches
5. **Professional Polish**: Achieve publication-ready quality

### 2.2 Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Chapter count | 6 (down from 7) | Final TOC |
| Minimum chapter length | 20 lines | Line count per chapter |
| Repetition instances | 0 | Content analysis |
| Hebrew-English mixing compliance | 100% CLS functions only | Code review |
| Abstract accuracy | Covers all major topics | Checklist verification |
| Compilation success | Clean compile, no errors | LaTeX compilation |
| Reading flow score | "Excellent" rating | Harari-style review |
| Code completeness | 100% runnable | Test execution |

### 2.3 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Coherence Score**: Reader should understand 90%+ of concepts without referring back
- **Progressive Complexity**: Each chapter should introduce 2-3 new major concepts
- **Zero Redundancy**: No paragraph should repeat information from previous chapters
- **Technical Accuracy**: All code examples must compile and execute successfully
- **Language Consistency**: 100% adherence to `\en{}`, `\num{}`, `\hebyear{}` conventions

## 9. Risk Management

### 9.1 Identified Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Breaking existing references during reorganization | High | High | Test compilation after each file change |
| Introducing new repetitions while removing old ones | Medium | High | Use content diff tool, multiple reviews |
| Code changes break functionality | Medium | Critical | Test all code before committing changes |
| LaTeX compilation errors from merging | High | High | Incremental compilation testing |
| Losing track of which version is authoritative | Medium | Medium | Clear file naming, backup old versions |
| Time overrun due to scope creep | Medium | Medium | Stick to PRD scope, defer nice-to-haves |

### 9.2 Contingency Plans

**If compilation fails:**
- Revert to last working version
- Apply changes incrementally
- Test each file individually

**If code doesn't execute:**
- Compare with working SDK example
- Test in clean Python environment
- Document known issues in README

**If review reveals major structural issues:**
- Escalate to project owner for decision
- Consider alternative chapter ordering
- May require additional iteration
